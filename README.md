# Zombie Survival
Zombie Survival Pygame

Here is my first python project I made entirely by myself! I made everything from scratch, including the code,images, and sounds.

You'll see that the one zombie doesn't die when the bullet is shot at him. I know that is a bug but I would like to move onto new projects, so I just left it.
Additonally, I should've added memory removal on each zombie when they die but I wanted to move on from this project.
